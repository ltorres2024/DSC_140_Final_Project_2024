### Soccer Analysis and Machine Learning
As a soccer fan, this project aims to dive deeper in some of the analytics regarding the top 5 European Leagues.

This is done by categorizing and implementing statistical functions on the data set **Football Events** 
that can be found in Kaggle

Followed by the implementation of KNN machine learning as well as a 2 hidden-layer Keras Tensorflow NN 
to predict the probability of scoring a goal based on the location
of the shot. 

Due to the volume of the data set, both ML models were run in the OSC cluster.
